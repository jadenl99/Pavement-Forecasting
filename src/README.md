# Jupyter Notebooks
The exploratory_analysis folder contains all the work I have done in the first part of the semester. 
Surveying trends in the data is intended to get familiar with it and to generate ideas about topics that 
can be explored more in-depth for the second part of the Fall 2023 semester.

The geographic_mapping folder contains the short stint of our team trying to map every slab to its 
approximate location on the map.

Finally, the nc_deterioration folder contains all the work I have done for the second part of the Fall 2023 
semester, identifying what factors contribute to accelerated pavement deterioration behavior, particularly for 
NC slabs on a slab-by-slab basis. There was also some analysis done for all the slabs in general, again on a 
slab-by-slab basis.

The exploratory_analysis folder contains all the work I have done in the first part of the semester. 
The work done here is primarily a surface-level view of the trends in the data to lay the groundwork
for more in-depth analysis in the second half of the semester. 

The geographic_mapping folder contains the short stint of our team trying to map every slab to its 
approximate location on the map.

Finally, the nc_deterioration folder contains all the work I have done for the second part of the Fall 2023 
semester, identifying what factors contribute to accelerated pavement deterioration behavior, particularly for 
NC slabs on a slab-by-slab basis. There was also some analysis done for all the slabs in general, again on a 
slab-by-slab basis.
